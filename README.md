FluxTasks
=========

FluxTasks is an infinitely flexible task and list management suite.

It represents a simple component that you can integrate with your existing website to provide a simple (or complex) method of showing off hierarchical collections of items.

Features:

* Sort your thoughts hierarchically in an ever expanding collection of nodes.
* Easily edit your list - just like a word processor.
* Prioritize your items - or not. Designate whether a branch should be sorted into a task list or just remain as a tree.
